I was very impressed with his CTA,\n\t\t\t\twhich featured a mountain landscape background and text that strongly resembled the component he was trying to match. In my opinion, it was a\n\t\t\t\tvery impressive looking way to begin on his components. Since that point, Sean has at the very least began to code each of his five components and\n\t\t\t\thas nearly completed two of them, but most importantly has left me EXTREMELY impressed with his fifth component (the Blog Feed). </p>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://seanedw1.github.io/wsp_edwards_sean/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">View Sean's GitHub Here.</a>\n\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t</section>\n<!-- End Team 2 -->\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n<!-- \tTeam 3 -->\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<section class=\"page team3\">\n\t\t\t<h2>Team 3: John & Rashaad</h2>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t\t\t\t<h3>John's review of Rashaad:</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Write your review here, bro.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://mangenius200.github.io/WSP/wsp_project-master/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">View Rashaad's GitHub Here.</a>\n\t\t\t</article>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t\t\t \t<h3>Rashaad's review of John:</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Write your review here, bro.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://johnkunkle1987.github.io/Web-Standards-Project/week_1_project/\" target=\"_blank\">View John's GitHub Here.</a>\n\t\t\t</article>\n\t\t</section>\n<!-- End Team 3 -->\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n<!-- \tTeam 4 -->\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<section class=\"page team4\">\n\t\t\t<h2>Team 4: Liu  & TJ</h2>\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t\t\t\t<h3>Liu's review of Tj:</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Write your review here, bro.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://fs-timothymccoy.github.io/WSP/ProjectPlanning/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">View Tj's GitHub Here.</a>\n\t\t\t</article>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<article>\n\t\t\t \t<h3>TJ's review of Liu:</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Over the course of this week i've had the pleasure of working with a very talented individual.

Karl’s 1st component was a search bar that he made very user friendly and simple to navigate for anyone who’s wanting to find a particular topic on that website. His 2nd component was a parallax that he demonstrated during his presentation in class which has taken a great journey to success using his interactive background to draw users in. There was a lot of jquery involved into his assignments and even though they’re not my strong suit helping him helped me to see more of certain javascript languages that I didn’t know. His 3rd component consisted of an API feature which uses query to place your zip code in an apartment finder to see what available apartments there are around for sell. Karl’s 4th component involved positioning using a contact component that demonstrates having a certain place on a screen where that particular contact belongs. Finally Karl’s 5th component was a scroll effect component that when you scroll down more information would appear which he has done amazing operating. His work was something very different than from what I’ve usually seen with the choices of components and that I enjoyed deeply being apart of. His work progressed from some jquery problems to making a successful attempt on all his components. </p>\n\t\t\t    <a href=\"http://kjrohr.github.io/wps_project/blog/index.html\"

Liu has been a very hardworking and helpful partner. I do admit that two heads are better than one when tackling an issue and i'm glad to have had the help. All of his components seem to be functioning properly and look up to snuff. Lastly, I would like to compliment his knowledge in sass which proves that the same things can be done in many different ways."]}],[{"start":{"row":110,"column":102},"end":{"row":111,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":["","\t\t\t\t"],"id":1446,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":111,"column":56},"end":{"row":111,"column":57},"action":"remove","lines":[" "],"id":1447,"ignore":true},{"start":{"row":111,"column":56},"end":{"row":112,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":["","\t\t\t\t"]}],[{"start":{"row":111,"column":56},"end":{"row":112,"column":4},"action":"remove","lines":["","\t\t\t\t"],"id":1448,"ignore":true},{"start":{"row":111,"column":56},"end":{"row":111,"column":57},"action":"insert","lines":[" "]}],[{"start":{"row":110,"column":102},"end":{"row":111,"column":4},"action":"remove","lines":["","\t\t\t\t"],"id":1449,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":67,"column":59},"end":{"row":67,"column":62},"action":"insert","lines":[" He"],"id":1450,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":67,"column":62},"end":{"row":67,"column":66},"action":"insert","lines":[" has"],"id":1451,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":67,"column":60},"end":{"row":67,"column":91},"action":"remove","lines":["He had also begun work on his  "],"id":1453}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":13},"end":{"row":84,"column":76},"action":"insert","lines":["http://mangenius200.github.io/WSP/wsp_project-master/index.html"],"id":1454,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":90,"column":13},"end":{"row":90,"column":82},"action":"insert","lines":["http://johnkunkle1987.github.io/Web-Standards-Project/week_1_project/"],"id":1455,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":129,"column":7},"end":{"row":129,"column":8},"action":"insert","lines":["j"],"id":1456}],[{"start":{"row":129,"column":7},"end":{"row":129,"column":8},"action":"remove","lines":["j"],"id":1457}],[{"start":{"row":129,"column":7},"end":{"row":129,"column":8},"action":"insert","lines":["j"],"id":1458}],[{"start":{"row":129,"column":7},"end":{"row":129,"column":8},"action":"remove","lines":["j"],"id":1508}],[{"start":{"row":129,"column":7},"end":{"row":129,"column":35},"action":"remove","lines":["Write your review here, bro."],"id":1509},{"start":{"row":129,"column":7},"end":{"row":129,"column":1426},"action":"insert","lines":["I've had the privledge to work with Karl on his assignment this week and not only are his components great but his intuition is even greater towards his assignments. Karl’s 1st component was a search bar that he made very user friendly and simple to navigate for anyone who’s wanting to find a particular topic on that website. His 2nd component was a parallax that he demonstrated during his presentation in class which has taken a great journey to success using his interactive background to draw users in. There was a lot of jquery involved into his assignments and even though they’re not my strong suit helping him helped me to see more of certain javascript languages that I didn’t know. His 3rd component consisted of an API feature which uses query to place your zip code in an apartment finder to see what available apartments there are around for sell. Karl’s 4th component involved positioning using a contact component that demonstrates having a certain place on a screen where that particular contact belongs. Finally Karl’s 5th component was a scroll effect component that when you scroll down more information would appear which he has done amazing operating. His work was something very different than from what I’ve usually seen with the choices of components and that I enjoyed deeply being apart of. His work progressed from some jquery problems to making a successful attempt on all his components.
