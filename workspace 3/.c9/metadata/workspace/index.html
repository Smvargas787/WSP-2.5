He had also begun to work on his Footer component, which was beginning to come along nicely as well. Since that point, Sean has begun coding each of the rest of his components and has nearly completed three of them. I am most impressed by his complete overhaul of his final component, the Blog Feed. At the beginning of this week, he hadn’t even started this component, but today I saw his most recent update and it’s coming along quite impressively.

Karl’s 1st component was a search bar that he made very user friendly and simple to navigate for anyone who’s wanting to find a particular topic on that website. His 2nd component was a parallax that he demonstrated during his presentation in class which has taken a great journey to success using his interactive background to draw users in. There was a lot of jquery involved into his assignments and even though they’re not my strong suit helping him helped me to see more of certain javascript languages that I didn’t know. His 3rd component consisted of an API feature which uses query to place your zip code in an apartment finder to see what available apartments there are around for sell. Karl’s 4th component involved positioning using a contact component that demonstrates having a certain place on a screen where that particular contact belongs. Finally Karl’s 5th component was a scroll effect component that when you scroll down more information would appear which he has done amazing operating. His work was something very different than from what I’ve usually seen with the choices of components and that I enjoyed deeply being apart of. His work progressed from some jquery problems to making a successful attempt on all his components. </p>\n\t\t\t    <a href=\"http://kjrohr.github.io/wps_project/blog/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">View Karl's GitHub Page</a>\n\t\t\t</article>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n            \n            \n\t\t</section>\t\t\n<!-- End Team 5 -->\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\n<!-- jquery -->\n\t\t<script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n\t<!--\t<script src=\"js/jquery-1.11.3.min.js\"></script> -->\n\t\t<script src=\"js/main.js\"></script>\n\t\t\n\t</body>\n</html>\n\n","undoManager":{"mark":97,"position":100,"stack":[[{"start":{"row":84,"column":78},"end":{"row":84,"column":81},"action":"insert","lines":["a k"],"id":92,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":81},"end":{"row":84,"column":86},"action":"insert","lines":["it th"],"id":93,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":86},"end":{"row":84,"column":90},"action":"insert","lines":["at c"],"id":94,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":90},"end":{"row":84,"column":92},"action":"insert","lines":["on"],"id":95,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":92},"end":{"row":84,"column":95},"action":"insert","lines":["nec"],"id":96,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":95},"end":{"row":84,"column":98},"action":"insert","lines":["ts "],"id":97,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":95},"end":{"row":84,"column":98},"action":"remove","lines":["ts "],"id":98,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":95},"end":{"row":84,"column":98},"action":"insert","lines":["ts "],"id":99,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":98},"end":{"row":84,"column":103},"action":"insert","lines":["his o"],"id":100,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":103},"end":{"row":84,"column":107},"action":"insert","lines":["wn s"],"id":101,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":107},"end":{"row":84,"column":108},"action":"insert","lines":["o"],"id":102,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":108},"end":{"row":84,"column":109},"action":"insert","lines":["c"],"id":103,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":109},"end":{"row":84,"column":110},"action":"insert","lines":["i"],"id":104,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":110},"end":{"row":84,"column":113},"action":"insert","lines":["al "],"id":105,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":113},"end":{"row":84,"column":115},"action":"insert","lines":["me"],"id":106,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":115},"end":{"row":84,"column":118},"action":"insert","lines":["dia"],"id":107,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":118},"end":{"row":84,"column":119},"action":"insert","lines":[" "],"id":108,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":119},"end":{"row":84,"column":123},"action":"insert","lines":["work"],"id":109,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":123},"end":{"row":84,"column":124},"action":"insert","lines":["."],"id":110,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":120},"end":{"row":84,"column":124},"action":"remove","lines":["ork."],"id":111,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":117},"end":{"row":84,"column":120},"action":"remove","lines":["a w"],"id":112,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":117},"end":{"row":84,"column":118},"action":"insert","lines":["a"],"id":113,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":84,"column":119},"end":{"row":85,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":["","\t\t\t\t"],"id":114,"ignore":true}],[{"start":{"row":64,"column":4},"end":{"row":68,"column":137},"action":"remove","lines":["<p>For the duration of this past week I have worked alongside Sean in our efforts to build and recreate our chosen components.","\t\t\t\tIn the beginning of the week, Sean showed me what he had currently built in regards to his chosen components.

only are his components great but his intuition is even greater towards his assignments. Karl’s 1st component was a search bar that he made very user friendly and simple to navigate for anyone who’s wanting to find a particular topic on that website. His 2nd component was a parallax that he demonstrated during his presentation in class which has taken a great journey to success using his interactive background to draw users in. There was a lot of jquery involved into his assignments and even though they’re not my strong suit helping him helped me to see more of certain javascript languages that I didn’t know. His 3rd component consisted of an API feature which uses query to place your zip code in an apartment finder to see what available apartments there are around for sell. Karl’s 4th component involved positioning using a contact component that demonstrates having a certain place on a screen where that particular contact belongs. Finally Karl’s 5th component was a scroll effect component that when you scroll down more information would appear which he has done amazing operating. His work was something very different than from what I’ve usually seen with the choices of components and that I enjoyed deeply being apart of. His work progressed from some jquery problems to making a successful attempt on all his components.
