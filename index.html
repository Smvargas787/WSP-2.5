			<h2>Biography</h2>
				<p>I'm the mind behind the peace that I wish to bring to the world of technology.
					Currently a Web Development/Design student attending Full Sail University during the day and a music lover during the night.
					My love for web designing took it's course in high school, once receiving my Diploma in May of 2014, I enrolled right after for the Fall semester into Full Sail to continue this technological passion.
					Currently I am working to collaberate with my fellow colleagues in Full Sail to enhance my skills on not only web designing but also graphic designing as well as music production.
					I love to continue to expand my knowledge through every industry rather than just one. I have so much pride and heart for taking nothing and creating it to something beautiful for my clients.
					Your vision becomes my passion. When I'm not studying you'll most likely always find me creating music. My other biggest passion that I hold is my love for the art of music. It's a great way to end my days and help me to maintain my mind at peace to spread onto my work.
					Although when I'm not making music I love to be around my family and spread the peace onto them as well. They're my reasonings for carrying all the passions that I do with so much pride.
					I vow to always represent not only my passion and dedication but yours as well into the work I create for you, my future clients.
