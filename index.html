				<h2>Biography</h2>
					<p>I'm the mind behind the peace that I wish to bring to the world of technology.
						Currently a Web Development/Design student attending Full Sail University during the day and a music lover during the night.
						My love for web designing took it's course in high school, once receiving my Diploma in May of 2014, I enrolled right after for the Fall semester into Full Sail to continue this technological passion.
						Currently I am working to collaberate with my fellow colleagues in Full Sail to enhance my skills on not only web designing but also graphic designing as well as music production.
						I love to continue to expand my knowledge through every industry rather than just one. I have so much pride and heart for taking nothing and creating it to something beautiful for my clients.
						Your vision becomes my passion. When I'm not studying you'll most likely always find me creating music. My other biggest passion that I hold is my love for the art of music. It's a great way to end my days and help me to maintain my mind at peace to spread onto my work.
						Although when I'm not making music I love to be around my family and spread the peace onto them as well. They're my reasonings for carrying all the passions that I do with so much pride.
						I vow to always represent not only my passion and dedication but yours as well into the work I create for you, my future clients.

				<h2>CTA</h2>
					<p>This section of the website allows users to immediately understand the topic that this website
						is about. It's bringing the user's attention to the topic of bullying and how the company
						wants viewers to participate into the movement of anti-bullying by finding out
						how they too can get involved to stop this world tragedy.

				<h3>Content Visualization</h3>
					<p>HTML: The visual above starts off with a title of, "Australian Anti Bullying Organization" which is in a heading
					tag of h1-h5. "Workshops, About Us, and Get Involved" are in a navigation unordered list tag. The words below it "Find the
					courage to take action may be a heading tag as well between h3-h5. "Get Involved" is an anchor tag to take you
					to the next page that will tell you how exactly to become involved with their movement.
					</p>
				<p>CSS: The css of the above image consist of the company's logo floated to the left with a width of half of the page. The title of the web page
					has a margin-bottom of 10px followed by the font-family of"Arial Narrow" which I believe is the
					default font for this website. Followed by that is the unordered list and that list has a display block of inline
					to make it appear across the screen as it shows. Making our way down the CTA of the page is a heading tag that has
					been possibly positioned down and or "margin auto 0;" to make it the center of the website also having the font size
					of 30px with a font-family of "Arial" bold. Between the CTA and anchor tag is a padding of 10px. "Get Involved" consist
					of a "border: 3px solid #99FF00" with a padding-bottom of 10px to separate the words and a color of "#99FF00". Finally the whole CTA consist
					of a background image that is possibly rounded, fixed, or cover.
