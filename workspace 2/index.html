			 	<h3>Lindsay's review of Sean:</h3>
				<p>For the duration of this past week I have worked alongside Sean in our efforts to build and recreate our chosen components. In the beginning of the week, Sean showed me what he had currently built in regards to his chosen components. I was very impressed with his CTA, which featured a mountain landscape background and text that strongly resembled the component he was trying to match. He had also begun to work on his Footer component, which was beginning to come along nicely as well. Since that point, Sean has begun coding each of the rest of his components and has nearly completed three of them. I am most impressed by his complete overhaul of his final component, the Blog Feed. At the beginning of this week, he hadn’t even started this component, but today I saw his most recent update and it’s coming along quite impressively. Ultimately, I strongly believe that Sean has made some very impressive progress over the course of the week and I am excited to see the final versions of his components.</p>

				<h3>John's review of Rashaad:</h3>
				<p>If the beggining of the week he was working with is components making sure they were working next he was
				refining the laninding page with codepen. He did well with the social media kit that connects to all of  his own social media.
				Component 3 was tricky, one of the effects for a word fade was not working at first.</p>

			 	<h3>TJ's review of Liu:</h3>
				<p>Over the course of this week i've had the pleasure of working with a very talented individual. Liu has been a very hardworking and helpful partner. I do admit that two heads are better than one when tackling an issue and i'm glad to have had the help. All of his components seem to be functioning properly and look up to snuff. Lastly, I would like to compliment his knowledge in sass which proves that the same things can be done in many different ways.</p>
